<p class="c13">THE RAPTURE QUESTION</p>
<p class="c20">I <small class="calibre12">BELIEVE THERE WILL THERE</small> be a rapture of the church because the Bible teaches that it will happen. Paul clearly taught the doctrine, and the New Testament unambiguously defines it. But before we go any further perhaps we should define the word. Our English word rapture comes from the Latin Vulgate which was a translation of the Bible produced by Jerome in the fourth century A.D. The Latin word is “rapiemur” and it is derived from the Greek word “harpadzō” which means to be “caught up, to seize, catch (away, up), pluck, pull, take (by force).</p>
<p class="c18">The rapture may be defined as the sudden removal of Christian believers from the Earth. Christians may disagree as to the timing of the rapture, but it is a biblical doctrine clearly revealed and explained by the apostles of Christ.</p>
<p class="c5">Here is Paul’s explanation of the doctrine:</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which <a id="page_274" class="calibre7"></a>sleep in Jesus (those who have died) will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up (harpadzō) together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(1 T<small class="calibre9">HESSALONIANS</small> 4:13-18).</p>
<p class="c17">Here Paul explains that the when the rapture occurs the Lord will descend from heaven to receive all believers, both those who have died and those who are still living. Those believers who have passed away will rise first. Then the living believers will be caught up and together we will be with Christ forever! No wonder we are to comfort one another with these words!</p>
<p class="c18">In another passage Paul explains the process of the rapture and the instantaneous change that all believers will experience when they are “caught up:”</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed” For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory</em>.</p>
<p class="c15">(1 C<small class="calibre9">ORINTHIANS</small> 15:50-54).</p>
<p class="c17"><a id="page_275" class="calibre7"></a>Paul is clear that each believer who has died will be raised up from the grave and united with a new body. Likewise, living believers will also experience a change and they will be clothed with an incorruptible immortal body. All of this will take place in the twinkling of an eye—it is an instantaneous transformation. What a wonderful teaching! I look forward to the rapture of the church!</p>
<p class="c17">The question that remains is the timing of the rapture, and this is where Christians tend to differ. What follows is my understanding of the timing of this great event.</p>
<p class="c18">In the past I have held and taught the pre-tribulation rapture position. However, after much prayer and study I came to realize that I could not stay with that position any longer. It is my opinion that the Scriptures seem to teach something different and I would like to share with you what I have learned. All I ask is that you take the information and consider it. My position comes from just reading the text and allowing the Word to develop my doctrine. If you believe something other than what I have written here that is okay—you have a God-given right to read the Bible and come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(2 T<small class="calibre9">HESSALONIANS</small> 2:1-5).</p>
<p class="c18"><a id="page_276" class="calibre7"></a>Evidently someone had come to the Thessalonian church and had confused them with a new teaching regarding the timing of the day of Christ. Here Paul reminds them to remember the things that he taught when he was last with them. Notice he says:</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="space">        </span>1). Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him…</p>
<p class="c33"><span class="space">        </span>2). That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</p>
<p class="c18">The important point I would like to emphasize here is the coming of Christ and our gathering together unto Him. The gathering he is talking about is the rapture—I don’t think anyone would dispute that—the saints, both the living and the dead will be gathered together at the harpadzo—the catching away or the rapture of the saints. The word “gathered” that Paul used here is the Greek word “episunagōgē” which means to “assemble together.” Again that is the rapture—to be assembled and gathered unto Christ.</p>
<p class="c5">Then Paul says:</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(2 T<small class="calibre9">HESSALONIANS</small> 2:3).</p>
<p class="c17">The day he is referring to is the Day of the Lord—for that day shall not come except: 1). There is a falling away first; 2). The “man of sin” (Antichrist) is revealed and released upon the earth.</p>
<p class="c17"><a id="page_277" class="calibre7"></a>In other words the rapture, which is our gathering together unto Christ, will not occur until the apostasy takes place, and the Antichrist appears on the earth to begin his evil work. It’s that simple. No arguing with the text or trying to make it fit into a mold. Essentially, all living born-again believers will be on the earth to witness an apostasy unlike any since the time before the flood. And that is why, in Matthew 24 for instance, Jesus repeats five times—“let no man deceive you.” Paul echoes that warning by saying “let no man deceive you by any means.”</p>
<p class="c17">The word apostasy correctly describes the “falling away.” This concept is derived from the Greek word “apostasia” which is described as “a falling away, a defection, or an apostasy from “the true religion” or the true faith. It is related to another Greek word which means “a divorce, (or a) repudiation.” This describes a total and complete denial or abandonment of a previously held belief.</p>
<p class="c17">It is my opinion that what Paul is describing is a complete abandonment of God as the creator of mankind. This could come about because of a new revelation or perhaps the discovery of an artifact which seems to offer conclusive proof that an alien civilization did indeed exist in the past, and that it is somehow linked with humanity. The repercussions of such a discovery will be staggering to say the least and life will never be the same.</p>
<p class="c17">Once this discovery is made (whether it is alien disclosure or perhaps an archeological discovery on Earth or even Mars), the old paradigm, the Judeo-Christian concept of God, will be shoved aside and disregarded. The ensuing vacuum will be filled with <em class="calibre6">the lie</em>, which is the revelation of Antichrist.</p>
<p class="c17">In a sense the theory of evolution is a foreshadowing of the great apostasy of the end-times. It has caused millions of people to abandon knowledge of the God of heaven for the nebulous god of natural selection and the sacraments of time and chance. In much the same <a id="page_278" class="calibre7"></a>way, the discovery of aliens or scientific proof of an alien artifact will cause billons of people to forsake the traditional concept of God. That describes an apostasy or falling away; for it will allow humanity to divorce God and subsequently embrace something entirely foreign—or <em class="calibre6">alien!</em></p>
<p class="c21"><strong class="calibre14">C<small class="calibre15">HRISTIAN</small> M<small class="calibre15">ARTYRS IN THE</small> T<small class="calibre15">RIBULATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(R<small class="calibre9">EVELATION</small> 20:4-6).</p>
<p class="c17">Notice first that these are Christian martyrs from the Tribulation period. They were murdered because they refused to worship the Antichrist Beast and receive his evil mark. They are part of the “dead in Christ” and are included in “the first resurrection” (Rev.20:6).</p>
<p class="c17">It should be obvious that there are not two first resurrections but only one. The only other resurrection referred to in this context is the second resurrection which the Bible calls the second death—and that has no power over these saints (Rev. 2:11; 20:14; 21:8).</p>
<p class="c17">If there is only one first resurrection then it stands to reason that these saints were raptured along with all of the other saints <a id="page_279" class="calibre7"></a>sometime after the Antichrist Beast came to power and began his murderous persecution of Christians. Since these Christian martyrs are killed during the terrible reign of the Antichrist I think we can reasonably conclude that the rapture of the church happens near the end of the Great Tribulation.</p>
<p class="c17">If the rapture happens before the Tribulation, and before the Antichrist begins to murder Christians, what should we do with these believers—because Scripture clearly says that they are part of the first resurrection? That is why I am convinced that Christians will face the Antichrist and at least a major portion of the Tribulation.</p>
<p class="c21"><strong class="calibre14">C<small class="calibre15">HRISTIANS</small> W<small class="calibre15">ILL</small> N<small class="calibre15">OT</small> F<small class="calibre15">ACE THE</small> W<small class="calibre15">RATH OF</small> G<small class="calibre15">OD</small></strong></p>
<p class="c5">S<small class="calibre12">OME WILL ARGUE THAT</small> as believers we are not appointed to wrath, and that certainly is true:</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(R<small class="calibre9">EV</small> 3:20).</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(1 T<small class="calibre9">HESS</small>. 5:9).</p>
<p class="c17">God has always preserved His saints in judgment—Noah in the ark, Lot removed from Sodom before the destruction of the city, the three Hebrew men in the fiery furnace of Babylon, etc. Christians will suffer persecution but will not taste the wrath of <a id="page_280" class="calibre7"></a>God which seems to begin after Revelation 15:1: “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.” In addition, Revelation 16:1 says, “And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.”</p>
<p class="c18">This is clearly the time when the Wrath of God will be poured out on the earth. Christians will not face this period of time because we will not be on the earth. The judgment of Babylon the Great has come and it will be destroyed; this is announced in Revelation 14:8 and finally in chapter 18. Please notice that right before the destruction of Babylon the Christians living on the earth are called out—raptured.</p>
<p class="c14"><em class="calibre6">“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues”</em></p>
<p class="c15">(R<small class="calibre9">EV</small> 18:4).</p>
<p class="c20">(Note: During the Tribulation the entire world should be considered Babylon the Great—the reign of Antichrist will be worldwide and the influence of his empire will encompass the entire globe).</p>
<p class="c21"><strong class="calibre14">T<small class="calibre15">HE</small> D<small class="calibre15">EATH OF</small> C<small class="calibre15">HRISTIAN</small> S<small class="calibre15">AINTS DURING THE</small> G<small class="calibre15">REAT</small> T<small class="calibre15">RIBULATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="c20">I<small class="calibre12">N REVELATION CHAPTER SIX</small> right after the opening of the fifth seal martyrs are seen in heaven—“under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held” (Vs.9) as well as the great multitude of 7:9. In chapter 14:12-13 <a id="page_281" class="calibre7"></a>John hears a voice bless those who die in the Lord. In 12:11 the saints overcome the dragon by the “word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death.” At 13:7 the Beast makes war with the saints and has the power to overcome them. At 17:6 we see martyrs who have died as a result of persecution by the Antichrist Beast and the False Prophet. The Whore of Babylon (who represents the spiritual elements of Beast worship) has a communion cup in her hand filled with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus Christ (Revelation17:6). And finally in Daniel 7:21 the Little Horn, who is the Antichrist Beast, is seen warring on the saints and prevailing against them.</p>
<p class="c17">Over and over Christians are pictured as martyrs during the Tribulation period. Some will argue that these are people who have come to faith in Christ sometime after the pre-tribulation rapture. I do not doubt that multitudes of people will come to Christ during the Tribulation. But I also believe that when the rapture occurs Christ will rapture all of the saints (the living and the dead) at the same time; and every one will be partakers of the first resurrection according to Rev. 20:4-6.</p>
<p class="c17">Read the gospel of John chapter six and take special note of how many times Jesus says that believers will be raised up “at the last day.” Four times He refers to this—John 6:39, 40, 44, and 54. The question is: when is the last day? The answer is—it is the day of Christ which is the day of His Parousia (His physical presence or arrival).</p>
<p class="c17">The rapture is called “a mystery” (1 Cor.15:51) and the book of Revelation does provide an answer when the mystery of God will be completed—10:7—“But in the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished…” and Rev.11:15, “and the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the <a id="page_282" class="calibre7"></a>kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and forever.”</p>
<p class="c17">It is my understanding that when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, that trumpet blast is “the last trump” that Paul referred to (1 Thess.4:16; See also Matt.24:29-31). Once the seventh angel sounds the narrative continues in chapter 14 with the angelic announcement of the fall of Babylon. Once that announcement is made the Lord calls His people out of Babylon (Rev.18:4). We must remember that at this time the entire world system will be called “Babylon the Great.”</p>
<p class="c17">The text says, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout”—could this shout be when the Lord calls His people out of Babylon—“Come out of her my people?” (Rev. 18:4). I ask this because once the Lords’ people are safely out of Babylon then the wrath of God begins to fall—again Babylon the Great will be a worldwide satanic system and the wrath of God will fall on the entire planet.</p>
<p class="c17">As believers in Christ in the 21st century we should not consider ourselves special or exempt from possible martyrdom; in fact millions of Christians were killed in the 20th century for their unwavering faith in Jesus and millions more are suffering even now as I write these pages. Consider for just a moment as you read these words that some of our Christian brothers and sisters are suffering and dying horribly. Just because we live in the West do we think we are exempt? Once the restrainer is removed it is possible that Christians in America, Europe, and in other places will become fodder for the sacrificial altars of the Beast—just as Christians suffer even now in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East today because of despotic governments and the Islamic beast. We place ourselves in spiritual danger if we do not seriously consider these things. It is just too <a id="page_283" class="calibre7"></a>easy to assume that we are going to be “raptured out of here” before everything breaks loose.</p>
<p class="c17">When thousands of UFO’s suddenly appear in the sky and the aliens make the astounding assertion that they are the “creators” of mankind what will Christians do? When the aliens back up their claims with incredible supernatural powers how will Christians react? Will they follow the aliens or will they finally realize that the end of days has come and prepare for the Tribulation and the return of Christ?</p>
<p class="c17">The truth is that many Christians are woefully unprepared for the end-times. Many do not seriously consider the implications of Bible prophecy and because of this they are not ready to face the coming great deception. As incredible as it sounds many Christians will more than likely fall in line lock-step behind the pied pipers of evil just like the rest of the world; and they will go marching into the false hope of a New Age utopia under the authority of the Beast.</p>
<p class="c17">Don’t be deceived by the doctrines of men. Just read the Bible comparing Scripture with Scripture and pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In that way the Lord will reveal His truth to you on this or any other matter. May God bless and keep you.</p>
